                    Hello! My name is Johan Guzman, and I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). 
                    A little bit about myself outside of Computer Science ... I was born and raised in Peru, South America, and I came to the United States to finish my high school education in 2014.
                    I really enjoy to play with dogs, especially with my little puppy Lucky! I'm a big fan of superheroes, especially from Marvel! I love soccer, so I try to follow the top professional leagues of the world as much as possible.
                    I also love helping kids who need academic help whether it is reading, math, or science; I believe all kids have the potential to be academically successful but is up to us, the adults, to help them achieve their sucess.        
                    <br><br>
                    I started my journey in the field of Computer Science back in high school during the summer after my Junior year when I self-learned the basics of Python programming. 
                    Back then, programming felt like such as strong tool to solve real-world problems in an Intelligibly manner applying logic and critical thinking. 
                    Also, the amount information that is documented online really amazed me. I really appreciate all the support of the community of programmers from all over the world, without them we could not learn and enjoy this art of coding!  
                    <br><br>
                    When I got to college, I continued to improve, expand, and perfectionate my programming skills and knowledge about Computer Science by actively challenging myself to learn and solve in and out of class problems.
                    I got the opportunity to master C++ in my lower-division courses, gain knowledge about complex algorithims and data structures, grasp embedded systems programming, and learn other languages such as C# and Java during my free time and  Hackathons. 
                    <br><br>
                    I am interested in software and app development, and I am currently looking for an internship opportunity for summer, 2020 in order to further develop my skills, grow professionally, and gain real-world experience.

                                This is my final project for the Intro to Embedded systems course that I took during my second year. 
                                For this project I developed a four-wheel motorized robot called Magnitie that is capable of detecting small size metal objects as it travels in a straight direction.
                                Magnitie keeps count of the number of metals that finds as it travels, and it stops if it detects a potential obstacle in fron it.<br><br>
                                Magnitie has incorporated an ATMega 1284 micro-controller to control its entire functionality, two DC motors that enable it to move, an inductive proximity sensor to detect metals, and an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles.
                                The software for this project was implemented using Atmel Studio and C programming language.

                                This is a project on which I worked with a partner on the development of a C++ program that simulated the functionality of a command shell program by applying object-oriented programming principles and design patterns.
                                We achieved the proper functionality of the program by parsing and analyzing user inputted linux commands, decomposing the commands into appropiate objects that formed a tree composite object, and executing those objects in a recursive manner using system calls.
                                <br><br>This program was progressively developed, adding extra features after unit testing the behavior of individual components by using the Google Test Framework for C++ and integration testing of the whole system using bash I/0 redirection.
